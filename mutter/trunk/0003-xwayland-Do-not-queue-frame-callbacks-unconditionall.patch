Subject: [PATCH 3/4] xwayland: Do not queue frame callbacks unconditionally

The removed comment is not longer true: XWayland schedules its VSYNC
from frame callbacks nowadays. Only sending callbacks when the surface
actor is unobscured makes XWayland throttle its VSYNC to 1/sec,
reducing repaints in many cases.
