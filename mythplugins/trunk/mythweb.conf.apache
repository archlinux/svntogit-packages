# Apache configuration directives for MythWeb.  Please read INSTALL for setup
# requirements and troubleshooting, along with the comments in this file.

############################################################################
# If you intend to use authentication for MythWeb (see below), you will
# probably also want to uncomment the following rules, which disable
# authentication for MythWeb's download URLs so you can properly stream
# to media players that don't work with authenticated servers.
#
#    <LocationMatch .*/pl/stream/[0-9]+/[0-9]+>
#        Allow from all
#    </LocationMatch>
#
#    <LocationMatch .*/music/stream.php>
#        Allow from all
#    </LocationMatch>


#
# CHANGE THESE PATHS TO MATCH YOUR MYTHWEB INSTALLATION DIRECTORY!  e.g.
#
#    /var/www
#    /home/www/htdocs
#    /var/www/html/mythweb
#    /srv/www/htdocs/mythweb
#
    <Directory "/srv/http/mythweb/data">
        Options -All +FollowSymLinks +IncludesNoExec
    </Directory>
    <Directory "/srv/http/mythweb" >

    ############################################################################
    # I *strongly* urge you to turn on authentication for MythWeb.  It is disabled
    # by default because it requires you to set up your own password file.  Please
    # see the man page for htdigest and then configure the following four directives
    # to suit your authentication needs.
    #
    #    AuthType           Digest
    #    AuthName           "MythTV"
    #    AuthUserFile       /var/www/htdigest
    #    Require            valid-user
    #    BrowserMatch       "MSIE"      AuthDigestEnableQueryStringHack=On
    #    Order              allow,deny
    #    Satisfy            any
    #
    #  * If you're running Apache earlier than 2.2, you will need to use
    #    the AuthDigestFile command instead of AuthUserFile (3rd line above).

        # Use the following environment settings to tell MythWeb where you want it to
        # look to connect to the database, the name of the database to connect to, and
        # the authentication info to use to connect.  The defaults will usually work
        # fine unless you've changed mythtv's mysql.txt file, or are running MythWeb on
        # a different server from your main backend.  Make sure you have mod_env enabled.
        #
            setenv db_server        "localhost"
            setenv db_name          "mythconverg"
            setenv db_login         "mythtv"
            setenv db_password      "mythtv"

        #
        # By default, MythWeb uses the hostname program to look up the hostname of the
        # machine it runs on.  If this reports incorrect data, or you run MythWeb on a
        # machine without the hostname program, set this to your current hostname.
        #
        #   setenv hostname         "my_mythbox"
        #

        # By default, php will always search the current directory for include files,
        # but if you wish to install these directories outside of the current path
        # (eg. for security reasons), set this variable to the directory that
        # contains the directories like languages and templates.  eg.
        #
        #   setenv include_path      "/usr/share/mythweb"

        # If you want MythWeb to email php/database errors (and a backtrace) to you,
        # uncomment and set the email address below.
        #
        #   setenv error_email       "mythweb_errors@example.com"
        #

        # If your local file system is something other than UTF-8, set this variable
        # so that the music and video portions of MythWeb can provide proper links
        # to your downloadable files.
        #
        #   setenv fs_encoding       "ISO-8859-1"
