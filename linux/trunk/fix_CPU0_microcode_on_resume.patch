Subject: x86, microcode: Update BSPs microcode on resume

In the situation when we apply early microcode but do *not* apply late
microcode, we fail to update the BSP's microcode on resume because we
haven't initialized the uci->mc microcode pointer. So, in order to
alleviate that, we go and dig out the stashed microcode patch during
early boot. It is basically the same thing that is done on the APs early
during boot so do that too here.

Subject: x86, microcode: Limit the microcode reloading to 64-bit for now

First, there was this: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88001

The problem there was that microcode patches are not being reapplied
after suspend-to-ram. It was important to reapply them, though, because
of for example Haswell's TSX erratum which disabled TSX instructions
with a microcode patch.

A simple fix was fb86b97300d9 ("x86, microcode: Update BSPs microcode
on resume") but, as it is often the case, simple fixes are too
simple. This one causes 32-bit resume to fail:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88391

Properly fixing this would require more involved changes for which it
is too late now, right before the merge window. Thus, limit this to
64-bit only temporarily.
