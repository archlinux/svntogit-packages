INTRODUCTION

This document pertains to the use of the Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer 
(also known as POV-Ray). It applies to all POV-Ray program source files, 
executable (binary) files, scene files, documentation files, help files, 
bitmaps and other POV-Ray files contained in official Company archives, 
whether in full or any part thereof, and are herein referred to as the 
"Software". The Company reserves the right to revise these rules in future 
versions and to make additional rules to address new circumstances at any 
time. Such rules, when made, will be posted in a revised license file, the 
latest version of which is available from the Company website at 
http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html.

USAGE PROVISIONS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, permission is granted 
to the User to use the Software and its associated files to create and render
images. The creator of a scene file retains all rights to any scene files
they create, and any images generated by the Software from them. Subject to
the other terms of this license, the User is permitted to use the Software in
a profit-making enterprise, provided such profit arises primarily from use of
the Software and not from distribution of the Software or a work including
the Software in whole or part.

Please refer to http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for licenses covering
distribution of the Software and works including the Software.

The User is also granted the right to use the scene files, fonts, bitmaps,
and include files distributed in the INCLUDE and SCENES\INCDEMO sub-
directories of the Software in their own scenes. Such permission does not
extend to any other files in the SCENES directory or its sub-directories. The
SCENES files are for the User's enjoyment and education but may not be the
basis of any derivative works unless the file in question explicitly grants
permission to do such.

This licence does not grant any right of re-distribution or use in any manner
other than the above. The Company has separate license documents that apply
to other uses (such as re-distribution via the internet or on CD) ; please
visit http://www.povray.org/povlegal.html for links to these. In particular
you are advised that the sale, lease, or rental of the Software in any form
without written authority from the Company is explicitly prohibited.

Notwithstanding anything in the the balance of this licence agreement,
nothing in this licence agreement permits the installation or use of the
Software in conjunction with any product (including software) produced
or distributed by any party who is, or has been, in violation of this
licence agreement or of the distribution licence
  (http://www.povray.org/distribution-license.html)
(or any earlier or later versions of those documents) unless:

   a. the Company has explicitly released that party in writing from the
      consequences of their non compliance; or
   b. both of the following are true:
         i. the installation or use of the Software is without the User
            being aware of the abovementioned violation; and
        ii. the installation or use of the Software is not a result (whether
            direct or indirect) of any request or action of the abovementioned
            party (or any of its products), any agent of that party (or any of
            their products), or any person(s) involved in supplying any such
            product to the User.
