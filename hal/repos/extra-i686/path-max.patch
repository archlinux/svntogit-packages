Subject: Bump HAL_PATH_MAX to 4096

Some bits in the code use realpath() with destination paths of size
HAL_PATH_MAX. This potentially breaks on systems where PATH_MAX is bigger than
HAL_PATH_MAX (which was 512 until now).

Since we can't use PATH_MAX directly (due to platforms like GNU/Hurd, which
apparently don't have it), just bump HAL_PATH_MAX to 4096 (as PATH_MAX is on
Linux), to avoid potential buffer overflows and also fix hal on Linux when
enabling FORTIFY in gcc.
